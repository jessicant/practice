Hello and welcome to the Husky Coding Life Tracker Back End team (what a mouthful lol).
This is a starter project to guage everyone's coding ability so Jess (backend lead dev)
can appriorately assign tasks to everyone.

Please kindly work on only the files with your name on it.

For this project, finish one py file. This file needs to be able to create an elementary representation of a to do list. 
You may use whatever data structure you feel comfortable with AND that you feel will appropriately address the problem to make
the list (arrays, dictionaries, hash table, whatever).

You program MUST be able to create a to do list (only one, you do not need to make multiple), add to the to do list, and remove from the to do list.
Try to follow good OOP principles (encapsulation, abstration, ect...) and general good style. You are free to import whatever libraries you feel
would be beneficial to your work. If you do so, please kindly make a "YourNameReq.txt" file and add what libraries you import in there,
so I know what to import. For example ("JessReq.txt")
